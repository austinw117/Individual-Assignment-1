    <h2>Traveling + Hiking + Gaming</h2>
    <p class = content>
        I enjoy traveling and having the oppurtunity to explore new areas and the 
        surrounding culture's people, architect, and FOOD! So, far I've seen Washington, California,
        New York, and the island of Saipan and I want to visit Europe next. I enjoy hiking having 
        hiked nearly 20 miles in Yosemite with much smaller hikes before and after that. I enjoy
        playing video games with one of my first being Halo 3 and my current favorites including
        Elden Ring, The Finals, and Overwatch.
