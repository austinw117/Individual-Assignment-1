    <h2>Patch Note Webscraper!</h2>
    <p class = content>
        My favorite personal project involves one of my all time favorite games: Overwatch. I've
        played this game since Freshman year of high school and have been within the Top 500 players
        in North America numerous times since then. I wanted to combine the game I've invested so much 
        time into a personal project in order to learn new skills such as mySQL and webscraping. I created a Python
        script which scrapes patch notes, details of how the game changes in any given update, and stores the
        changes to mySQL database. This enabled me to see which hero got changed the most since their release
        and get a better grasp at which characters were more/less balanced througout the lifetime of the game.
        In the future, I plan to release the code to my GitHub.
